# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 11/23/2019 

Started freecodecamp algorithms challenges, starting with symmetric difference

**Link to work:** [Symmetric Difference](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/find-the-symmetric-difference)

### Day 2: 11/24/2019

Continued algorithms work, completed Inventory Update and No Repeats

[No repeats please](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/no-repeats-please)


### Day 3: 11/25/2019

Continued fcc algo work. Struggling with Pairwise, but excited to progress. I was not motivated to fit coding in today but I made myself sit down for the minimum hour

### Day 4: 11/26/2019

Did not get to coding before 11 pm. Could not find motivation to continue freecodecamp today so I did a little tkinter hello world thing and changed the buttons around and 2 project euler problems just to stay in the habit of programming. PE doesn't like the solutions to be published so I'm gonna keep those to myself.
Also I refreshed myself a bit on what ridge and lasso regression is, I think I'll start doing some data sciency projects tomorrow. I want to do DS or DE but I'm having fun just programming little algorithmic things at the moment.

### Day 5: 11/27/2019

Set up a new theme for jupyter notebooks and got to work on building a support vector classifier for credit card fraud. Downloaded a data set from kaggle, see link. Read about complexity for SVM and LinearSVM, and about convergence for linear optimization models (namely the LinearSVM itself). Will resume work on this later (today?) after I eat and take care of administrative teaching stuff.

### Day 6: 11/29/2019

Ran PCA on the credit card fraud data. Used seaborn to make a fairly useless scatterplot I think. Beats doin nothin for the day

### Day 7: 11/30/2019

Implemented bubble sort and selection sort from the freecodecamp algorithm exercises

### Day 8: 12/1/2019
Didn't program today, but I did find a DS&A book that I read for about an hour. Gonna count it because my CS skills in general need to be improved (might be cheating who cares)
