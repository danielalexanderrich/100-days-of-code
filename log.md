### Day 1: 11/23/2019 

Started freecodecamp algorithms challenges, starting with symmetric difference

### Day 2: 11/24/2019

Continued algorithms work, completed Inventory Update and No Repeats

### Day 3: 11/25/2019

Continued fcc algo work. Struggling with Pairwise, but excited to progress. I was not motivated to fit coding in today but I made myself sit down for the minimum hour

### Day 4: 11/26/2019

Did not get to coding before 11 pm. Could not find motivation to continue freecodecamp today so I did a little tkinter hello world thing and changed the buttons around and 2 project euler problems just to stay in the habit of programming. PE doesn't like the solutions to be published so I'm gonna keep those to myself.
Also I refreshed myself a bit on what ridge and lasso regression is, I think I'll start doing some data sciency projects tomorrow. I want to do DS or DE but I'm having fun just programming little algorithmic things at the moment.
